"Snap" a photo of a track or album on Spotify

Using puppeteer might be overkill but here goes!

#### Problems I ran into
- If puppeteer does not install, use the following command (from issue #[375](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/375)):
```
sudo npm install --save puppeteer --unsafe-perm=true
```
